   INT. GORGE - NIGHT
            MATTY RAY, 30’s, stares out at a beautiful gorge. At his side is MOLLY, 30’s, emotionally grounded but physically deteriorating. Their eyes are red from crying.
        MOLLY
                Promise me something.
        MATTY
                Anything.
        MOLLY
                Promise me you’ll never eat meat.
            Matty laughs.
        MATTY
                Can I tell you a secret? I love eating meat.
        MOLLY
                No!
        MATTY
                Yeah. I really miss it. 
                (smiles)
                 But I won’t eat it. I promise.
        MOLLY
                I want you to live a good life.
        MATTY
                I don’t want to. Not without you.
            She smiles sadly.
        MOLLY
                You don’t have a choice.
            
        INT. BEDROOM - MORNING
            Matty wakes up in bed. Alone. He has a full beard. Years have passed. He looks worse for the wear.
            
        EXT. BACK YARD - DAY
            Matty toils in the sun, shoveling manure from one bin to another in a complex composting system.
            
        INT. BATHROOM - DAY
            BLACK WATER runs down the drain as Matty vigorously washes his soiled hands.
            
        INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
            What looks like a small altar. There’s a few pictures of Matty and Molly, and a decorative urn.
            
        INT. KITCHEN - DAY
            Matty fills up a flask with bourbon.
            
        INT. PICKUP TRUCK - DAY
            Matty drives, swigging from his flask. He scans the radio dial on his truck’s stereo. There’s STATIC on every channel. That’s weird...
            
        EXT. TOWN - DAY
            A very small, rural town. Charming and quaint in the way that a gold rush ghost town is charming and quaint.
            Matty’s pickup truck swerves into the general vicinity of a parking spot, jutting out of the lines haphazardly.
            
        EXT. DINER - SAME
            Matty stands outside, smoking a cigarette, looking out at the placid town. He teeters a little bit but holds steady.
            The door to the diner opens and LILITH (50’s, no-nonsense) comes out holding a takeout bag.
        LILITH
                You know, if you took a shower once in a while, I’d consider letting you back inside.
        MATTY
                I like it better on the outside.
        LILITH
                There’s less offensive ways to keep people at arms length than smelling like shit all the time.
            He flicks his cigarette out into the road.
        MATTY
                I’ll take your word for it.
            She hands him the takeout bag.
        LILITH
                One veggie burger. Tastes like cardboard, just the way you like it.
            He nods appreciatively. Lilith walks back inside.
            Matty starts across the street, toward his truck. Suddenly a HUGE SHADOW passes over him, eclipsing the sun for a moment.
            He stops dead in his tracks. Very, very slowly, he turns around. Almost as if against his better judgement.
            In his eyes: Awe. Disbelief. Terror. Hanging in the sky is a MASSIVE, BEAUTIFUL STARSHIP. A UFO.
            
        INT. DINER - SAME
            Lilith wipes down a table. A LOW, SONOROUS hornlike sound SHAKES the sky, rattling the windows.
            
        EXT. DINER - SAME
            Lilith pokes her head out of the diner. Her jaw drops at the site of the UFO, and Matty walking towards it, looking up as if in a trance.
        LILITH
                Matty!
            Another LOUD, HORNLIKE SOUND. Matty is ENGULFED IN LIGHT.
            
        INT. STARSHIP - CONTINUOUS
            A large, white, cavernous room. There’s no light source, but it’s perfectly lit. The room is a white void. Standing in the center of it, smiling, is THE VISITOR.
            He looks human, though he’s in an oddly formal outfit. His mannerisms are at times a bit robotic. He has a personality, it’s just not a human one.
        VISITOR  (V.O.)
                Welcome.
            Matty looks around the void, still holding his takeout bag.
        VISITOR  (V.O.)
                It’s a pleasure to meet you, Matthew Ray.
        MATTY
                Get out of my head!
            Finally The Visitor speaks out loud.
        VISITOR
                You find telepathy unnerving. I apologize.
        MATTY
                Where am I?
        VISITOR
                This is my ship. Unfortunately for you, the people of Earth are thousands of years behind schedule in their evolution. I am here to speed along the process for you and free you from the illusion that imprisons you.
            Matty looks like a cornered animal.
        MATTY
                This is a dream. This isn’t real.
        VISITOR
                Precisely right. The dream of duality. All beings are one being. All things are one thing. Allow me to show you.
            The Visitor reaches out, extending his finger towards Matty.
        MATTY
                Don’t even think about touching me-
            The Visitor’s finger PRESSES into Matty’s forehead.
            A QUICK SERIES OF IMAGES:
            -Matty in bed, holding Molly. The definition of their bodies vibrates and we see them for a moment as two identical cores of energy, pulsating light merging into one.
            -Matty and Lilith stand facing each other. One morphs into the other. And back. They merge into a ball of light.
            -A crowd of people walking into a field, as if in a daze.
            -A root system, merging into a single field of energy.
            -A pile of BODIES laying in a field.
            -Outer space. A trail of light connecting all the planets in the solar system in a glowing web of energy.
            
        INT. STARSHIP - DAY
            Matty SNAPS back to.
        VISITOR
                Now do you see?
            Matty PUKES all over the floor. The Visitor looks unfazed.
        MATTY
                (panting)
                 Everyone was me. And I was them.
        VISITOR
                That’s correct. To others in the galaxy, this truth is self evident. I am here to free the people of your town from this illusion. Think of it as a pilot program. If all goes well, we may be able to save your species.
        MATTY
                Save us from what?
        VISITOR
                Yourselves, of course. I have chosen you, Matthew Ray, as my ambassador.
        MATTY
                And you’re gonna, what...?
        VISITOR
                Return you to your source.
        MATTY
                You’re going to kill us.
        VISITOR
                The ego is not real. You cannot kill something that does not exist.
            
        INT. DINER - DAY
            The town is gathering in the diner. Matty steps on a chair at the front of the room. An awkward pause.
        MATTY
                So... Bad news. Apparently all of this is an illusion. And it’s coming to an end. I’m sorry.
            Matty gets off the chair and starts walking away. The room breaks out into a dozen voices shouting at once. Lilith steps in Matty’s path.
        LILITH
                Where do you think you’re going? Get back up there.
            Matty does, reluctantly.
        MATTY
                Uh, so, this man, this... being... he showed me. The lives we’re living here- they’re based on a lie. None of this is real. We just can’t see it because our evolution has been stunted.
        TOWNIE #1
                (disgusted)
                 Evolution?!
        TOWNIE #2
                What’s gonna happen to us?
        MATTY
                Life as we know will be over. But we’ll return to our natural state, which is sort of like, I don’t know, unconditional love.
        TOWNIE #2
                Why doesn’t this guy come down here and tell us himself?
        MATTY
                First of all, he’s not a guy. Guys don’t travel in flying saucers. And second of all... Apparently he wants me to be your ambassador.
            A MURMUR of disapproval ripples through the crowd. DAVID, a burly line cook, steps forward.
        DAVID
                No offense Matty, but you’re not a very stable person and I don’t feel comfortable with you representing us. 
                (to the group)
                 He nearly killed Duke last summer. Now he’s s’posed to be our leader?
        MATTY
                I’m not you’re leader. I’m just a messenger. And I know this is an unpopular opinion, but Duke had it coming.
            Matty looks around at the scared, angry townspeople.
        MATTY  (CONT’D)
                Look, I don’t think it matters if the ambassador is me or the next guy. The end result is the same. Life as we know it is over.
            
        INT. STARSHIP - DAY
            Matty has a clipboard in his hand.
        MATTY
                Okay. We have questions.
            A series of quick cuts from the DINER to the STARSHIP.
            DINER:
            People in the diner shout out questions to Matty.
        TOWNIE #2
                Do we have a choice in this?
            STARSHIP:
        VISITOR
                Choice is an illusion.
            DINER:
        TOWNIE #2
                What the hell does that mean?!
        MATTY
                I think it means No.
        TOWNIE #1
                Ask him about aliens. Ask if they’re real.
            STARSHIP:
        MATTY
                Are aliens real?
            The Visitor gives a disappointed look, bordering on contempt.
        MATTY  (CONT’D)
                I promised I’d ask. 
                (BEAT)
                 I’m just gonna put down yes.
            He looks one more time to the Visitor for confirmation but receives nothing. Jotting down in his notebook-
        MATTY  (CONT’D)
                (to himself)
                 I’m just gonna put down yes.
            DINER:
        TOWNIE #2
                Do we go to heaven when we die?
            STARSHIP:
        VISITOR
                Only in the sense that heaven is a word for something you don’t understand.
            DINER:
        TOWNIE #1
                There’s six people in the county jail right now, some for violent crimes. Are they going to heaven?
            STARSHIP:
        VISITOR
                Yes.
        MATTY
                Really? So nothing we do on earth has consequences.
        VISITOR
                Misguided people do misguided things. The more horrifying and disturbing their actions- the more entrenched in the illusion they are. The ego sees acts of hatred and it demands punishment. But the ego is wrong. The ego is always wrong. The illusion is the punishment. Leaving the illusion is the reward. And the reward is the same for everybody. Because everybody is the same.
            Matty writes the answer down, talking aloud as he does:
        MATTY
                “Bad people go to heaven too.”
            The Visitor looks unimpressed. Matty checks his notes. Most of the questions have Y
 afterwards with “N” circled. But there’s a few write-in answers:
            “What’s the meaning of life? - You’ll see.”
            “What’s your favorite comfort food? - Chicken Gumbo.”
        MATTY  (CONT’D)
                Let’s see. Heaven. Meaning of life. Oh, right. People want you to turn the phones and cars back on.
        VISITOR
                That’s not going to happen.
        MATTY
                Can you at least make the TVs work again? Mrs. Woodley can’t watch Jeopardy. It would be... better for everyone if she could watch Jeopardy.
        VISITOR
                No.
            Matty sighs, looks the Visitor up and down.
        MATTY
                You’re kind of an asshole, aren’t you?
            DINER:
            Matty addresses the small crowd.
        MATTY  (CONT’D)
                Negotiations are ongoing. It’s tense at times. But progress is being made.
            STARSHIP:
            Matty and the Visitor are playing Connect 4. Matty puts his first checker down.
        VISITOR
                You won.
        MATTY
                We just started.
        VISITOR
                But you’re going to win.
        MATTY
                You can see that? If you can see it, can’t you change it? 
                (putting down his checkers)
                 This isn’t fun. None of this is fun.
        VISITOR
                We could play Sorry.
        MATTY
                Enough with the games. People want to know how much time they have left. Rocko’s planning a barbecue but no one will commit cause they’re afraid you’re gonna kill us at any moment.
        VISITOR
                The answer is no. The time is nearly upon us. The reintegration has begun.
            END MONTAGE.
            
        INT. DINER - DAY
            Matty walks up to the front of the room. People are anxiously awaiting. He takes a deep breath.
        MATTY
                Apparently the reintegration process is beginning. It’ll take effect with the new moon.
        TOWNIE #2
                That’s less than two days!
            JENNY, a kind, heavyset woman, begins weeping. Through tears:
        JENNY
                What’s gonna happen to my family? My babies. I can’t lose them.
        MATTY
                Hey, hey. You’re not gonna lose anybody. No one’s gonna lose anyone. We’ll be together.
            Jenny’s cries turn to sniffles. She looks up at Matty, scared, vulnerable.
        MATTY  (CONT’D)
                Your family is going to be okay. I promise.
            
        INT. STARSHIP - EVENING
            Matty and The Visitor are lounging around. Matty lays back, propped up on his elbows. The Visitor eats chicken wings, licking buffalo sauce off his fingers.
        MATTY
                Am I gonna forget her? Molly? When you showed me the other side, I saw her. But everything bled together. Will she be there? Will I remember her?
        VISITOR
                Why does that matter?
            Matty thinks about it. How do I say this?
        MATTY
                She’s been gone for years and I can still barely get out of bed in the morning. The only reason I do is because I can’t sit there with my thoughts anymore. And the worst part is- no matter how much I remember, I can feel myself starting to forget. Little things. 
                (MORE)
        MATTY  (CONT’D)
                Her nicknames for me. The noises she’d make when I’d rub her feet, like she was in pain. But if I stopped she would say, “Keep going,” cause it was the good kind of pain.
        VISITOR
                Good... pain?
        MATTY
                Yeah. That’s kind of what the memories are. Good pain. Because it hurts to think about. But if I lost them, if I just let them slip away... I’d have nothing left.
        VISITOR
                May I make an observation?
        MATTY
                Sure. Why not.
        VISITOR
                You cling to your grief as though it sustained you. But nothing could be further from the truth. Your sentimentality is what holds you back.
            Matty takes this in. He doesn’t like it.
            
        INT. DINER - NIGHT
            Matty walks in the diner. Lilith is mopping the floor, in a sort of focused, angry trance.
        MATTY
                How about one last veggie burger? For old time’s sake.
        LILITH
                Kitchen’s closed.
        MATTY
                You know you don’t need to do that anymore. Mopping the floor.
        LILITH
                I find it soothing.
            She puts down the mop and looks at him angrily.
        LILITH  (CONT’D)
                Did you even try to stop it?
        MATTY
                What do you mean? What do you want me to do? I’m powerless here.
            She just stares at him.
        MATTY  (CONT’D)
                It’s gonna be okay. I saw her, Lil.
        LILITH
                You saw who?
            He doesn’t respond, a little ashamed he let that slip out. A look of realization and disappointment washes over Lilith.
        LILITH  (CONT’D)
                Well now we know why he chose you.
        MATTY
                What’s that supposed to mean?
        LILITH
                It means the last two years you’ve walked around like a man with a death wish. You know Molly was like a little sister to me. I was grieving too. We all were.
        MATTY
                It was a little different for me.
        LILITH
                Because you pushed us all away and let your life crumble to dust like shit in the sun. That’s why he chose you, Matty. Cause you have nothing to live for.
        MATTY
                Oh and you do? Like what? Mopping the floor? Fucking... sunsets?
        LILITH
                Yeah. Mopping the floor and fucking sunsets. And last I checked, no one had the right to take that away from me. Shame on you, Matty Ray.
            She throws the mop down and walks out of the room.
            
        INT. MATTY’S HOUSE - NIGHT
            Matty sits on his couch, just staring at the little altar for Molly in the corner of the room.
            There’s a knock on the door. He gets up and opens it.
            Standing in the doorway is Jenny, holding a fresh pie.
        JENNY
                I wanted to thank you for all you’ve done for us. For representing us up there. I know you’ve been through a lot. But we appreciate you.
            She holds out the pie.
        JENNY  (CONT’D)
                I bet they don’t have pies like this where we’re going.
            Matty takes the pie, smiling.
        MATTY
                No one has pies like yours, Jenny. Thank you.
        JENNY
                Goodnight.
            Matty closes the door. He walks back over to the couch and sits down, holding the pie, staring at the urn on the altar.
            A FLASH of an image from Matty’s first UFO experience: A pile of bodies lying in the field. Another FLASH: Closer. The bodies belong to the town’s people. Among them, Jenny.
            Matthew looks like he’s going to be sick.
            
        INT. STARSHIP - DAY
            The Visitor frowns at Matty.
        VISITOR
                I don’t understand.
        MATTY
                You said it’s my job to represent them, and that’s what I’m doing.
        VISITOR
                It’s your job to make them see.
        MATTY
                Well I don’t know what to tell you. They don’t want to see. They don’t want to go.
        VISITOR
                And what do you want? If it were up to you?
        MATTY
                Is it up to me?
            The Visitor just stares at him. Matty thinks it over, long and hard. Finally Matty shakes his head.
        MATTY  (CONT’D)
                I’m sorry.
            Suddenly the Visitor looks pissed.
        VISITOR
                What is it with you humans?! We’ve tried so hard with you! The pyramids. The dolphins. Nothing gets through to you!
        MATTY
                Wait, what about the dolphins?
        VISITOR
                Your species won’t make it. You know that, don’t you? This is your last chance.
            Matty doesn’t say anything. The Visitor gets a grip on himself.
        VISITOR  (CONT’D)
                Once the reintegration process has started, there’s only one way to stop it. But it’s primitive. It’s not how we like to do things anymore.
        MATTY
                What is it?
            The Visitor doesn’t even want to say it.
        VISITOR
                A sacrifice.
        MATTY
                A sacrifice? Like a human sacrifice?
        VISITOR
                The energy release can be used as a conduit to subvert the reintegration. But it can’t just be anybody. You’re the one I chose for this. So it would have to be you.
            This sinks in slowly.
        MATTY
                Well I didn’t see that coming.
            
        EXT. TOWN - DUSK
            The Starship hangs over the town, lit up like a Christmas tree in the fading dusk.
            
        INT. DINER - NIGHT
            Candles lit in a large circle on the floor. In the center, Matty lays on his back. Lilith kneels over his body, a giant BUTCHER KNIFE poised over Matty’s heart.
        LILITH
                I really don’t want to do this.
        MATTY
                You sure? Cause you sort of jumped at the opportunity.
        LILITH
                What if the knife gets stuck in your sternum?
        MATTY
                Well, that would be bad, Lil. Maybe David should it.
            In the corner of the room, David shakes his head.
        DAVID
                I don’t want any part of this.
        MATTY
                I’m trying to save your lives. If you want to live, this is the only way.
        LILITH
                I can do it. I can do it.
        MATTY
                Please make it quick.
        LILITH
                Well that’s why I’m worried about it getting stuck in your sternum.
        MATTY
                And I share your concern.
            She takes a deep breath. She holds the knife up, her hands shaking a little, about to bring it down...
        LILITH
                Are you ready?
        MATTY
                Just do it!
            Suddenly- A LOW, LOUD HORNLIKE SOUND. Lilith is so startled she drops the knife. It falls, LODGING into Matty’s sternum.
        MATTY  (CONT’D)
                Jesus Christ!
            Matty sits up, the tip of the knife jutting out of him. He pulls it out as BRIGHT LIGHT OVERTAKES THE DINER.
            
        INT. STARSHIP - SAME
            Matty’s suddenly in the Starship with the Visitor. He rubs his chest, pained. There’s a small blood stain. Not too bad.
        VISITOR
                What do you think you’re doing?
        MATTY
                They were going to sacrifice me. Like you said.
        VISITOR
                That was not a sacrifice.
        MATTY
                Why the hell not? Were we supposed to burn sage or something?
        VISITOR
                Killing you wouldn’t be a sacrifice, because you want to die.
        MATTY
                No I don’t.
        VISITOR
                Yes Mathew. You do.
            Matty looks about ready to cry from frustration.
        MATTY
                Well what the hell do you want, then?! You said it had to be me. If killing me isn’t going to do it, what will? You want the deed to my house?
        VISITOR
                It can only be a sacrifice if it’s something you’re unwilling to part with.
            Slowly it dawns on Matty what’s being asked of him.
        MATTY
                She’s already gone.
        VISITOR
                But she’s not, is she? Not for you.
        MATTY
                (eyes welling up)
                 No. Don’t ask me to do that.
            Matty looks like he’s about to break down.
        MATTY  (CONT’D)
                Don’t take her from me.
            The Visitor approaches him slowly, waiting for Matty to make eye contact. Finally he does. Matty’s a few breaths away from a full on panic attack.
        VISITOR
                It’s the only way.
            The Visitor reaches out his hand, pausing right before touching Matty. He looks to Matty for some sort of consent.
            Matty gives him the smallest of nods. Do it. The Visitor TOUCHES Matty on the forehead.
            An INTENSE STREAM OF QUICK IMAGES. All of which involve Molly and Matty, or Matty grieving her death. They pass by too quickly to fully register any of them.
            The last one is the two them in a field, holding hands. Then she blips out. It’s just Matty. Alone in the field.
            
        EXT. TOWN - DAY
            Beautiful, quiet. The UFO is gone. The water tower looming over the town is the only object in an otherwise empty sky.
            Matty pulls up to the diner. He gets out of his truck. Lilith walks outside to greet him.
        LILITH
                You’re not going to the barbecue?
        MATTY
                Nah. I wanna hit the road before it gets too late.
        LILITH
                You know where you’re headed?
        MATTY
                Not yet. 
                (BEAT)
                 I brought some things for you.
            He reaches into the bed of his truck and pulls out a small cardboard box.
        MATTY  (CONT’D)
                Not sure if you’ll want them, but I figured I’d ask.
            He hands her the box. Inside, pictures of Molly. A woman’s sweater. The decorative urn from Matty’s altar.
            Lilith gasps.
        LILITH
                Matty...
        MATTY
                I know she meant a lot to you.
        LILITH
                She meant a lot to you too.
            He looks at Lilith with sympathy.
        MATTY
                I’m sure she did.
            He shifts uncomfortably as she looks through the box.
        MATTY  (CONT’D)
                If you don’t want it I can throw it out.
        LILITH
                No, I’ll take it.
            She looks him over, a mix of pity and gratitude in her eyes.
        LILITH  (CONT’D)
                You really don’t remember.
        MATTY
                I know it happened. And I believe that I loved her. But it feels like it was someone else’s life. And I just wanna get on with my own.
        LILITH
                (trying to brighten)
                 How about one last veggie burger for the road?
        MATTY
                That sounds great, Lil.
        LILITH
                I’ll bring it out.
        MATTY
                (calling after her)
                 You know what? Make it a cheeseburger. Medium well.
            She pauses, nods sadly and goes inside.
            Matty pulls out a cigarette and smokes, staring out at the town. It’s quiet. Peaceful. And then... Something strange happens to his face. Something we haven’t seen before.
            He smiles.
            THE END
